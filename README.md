IMLS Matters

Like many others I am dismayed by the effort to end IMLS. I know IMLS matters to so many people. I put together the [following site](https://imls-matters.github.io/imlsmatters/) to collect and share stories of how "IMLS matters" to people. Please consider [submitting a story](https://imls-matters.github.io/imlsmatters/
). 

Read more about efforts to end IMLS [here](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/31/nx-s1-5334415/doge-institute-of-museum-and-library-services). Sign a petition to support IMLS [here](https://www.everylibrary.org/statement_imls_staff_administrative_leave). Support IMLS by [calling and writing to your representatives](https://www.congress.gov/members/find-your-member).
