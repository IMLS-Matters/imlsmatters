"I got my start in digital librarianship on a IMLS grant-funded position at the Louisiana State Museum in 2005. I was a newly minted Master's in Museum Studies professional, looking for my first job in museums with the seemingly catch-22 of needing years of experience for the most entry level positions. I was particularly thrilled since this job at the time married the digital and physical worlds in the scope of the grant project, with hands on collection and digitization work, and of course also providing that key experience I was so desperately seeking to get my foot in the door. I have since spent 17 years working in academic libraries managing digital initiatives, and I think back to this experience and am so so grateful it was there to lead me to where I am today.

"During the early days of the Pandemic, IMLS was the best resource on what to do regarding treating archival objects + book loans. They were fair and scientifically based, and helped to calm down a number of librarians from across the US through their webinars on the topic.",Ben Kass (Virginia),
"IMLS matters to me and my library community, a Title I school in Delaware. We depend on IMLS funding in Delaware because it allows us to be included in the statewide library catalog. That means that our students and teachers can access books from libraries across the entire state. This allows us to access eBooks from Hoopla and Libby, which IMLS also funds in Delaware. IMLS also funds the statewide courier delivery which allows those books to travel to and from every library in the state. This helps my students to read and learn about anything that their hearts desire - from books about volleyball and cooking and rocks and minerals to books about Sonic the Hedgehog and the Wizard of Oz. Access to every book in our state allows my students the opportunity to foster their love of reading and know no limits to what they can read about. 
IMLS also funds professional development for librarians in the state of Delaware. Being a professional librarian is extremely important to me. It is my life's work. It is so important to me that I have access to learning opportunities to better myself, to be the best librarian that I can be for my students!",Sara Thomas (Delaware),
"IMLS is the reason I have a career in libraries. I joined a project funded by IMLS as a graduate student worker; the Religion in North Carolina Digital Collections, in 2012. This project was led by Duke Divinity School Library, and had UNC Chapel Hill and Wake Forest University as collaborative partners. When I graduated, the project coordinator position was open for the final year of the grant, and this was my first step into what became a decade of working in libraries. What sticks with me most, however, is the impact that this government funding had on the people we served. This project worked to bring collections that were being stored in people’s attics, basements, and back rooms to new audiences. Yes, it focused on digitising many of the (scarce, not-digitally available) small-time newsletters, bulletins, church directories, and synagogue cookbooks in the collections of these universities, but the crucial, good thing that this project accomplished was to bring federal funding to small religious communities whose materials the universities had not historically deemed interesting or worthy of collecting; it forged new relationships, and allowed myself and others on the project to act as a bridge for preserving scarce materials that might otherwise have been lost to disaster. Frankly, some of the collections we digitized came from communities in western North Carolina; I don’t know what has become of he originals in the wake of the horrific flooding and mudslides of 2024. Human lives are paramount; but history and culture are vital to human life, and also worth preserving. I owe a great deal to IMLS, personally and professionally, as do many communities in NC and beyond. I’m forever grateful for the opportunities they furnished to students, communities, and heritage.", Beth DeBold, 
"The funds IMLS provides Montanans helps bring quality, essential library services to all Montanans. Their steadying leadership has made libraries better across the country, as well as improving the lives of those in my state. We rely upon and require their continued funding and leadership. I am a prior member and a former chair of the Montana State Library Commission.", Bruce Newell (Montana), 
"My first role after grad school was as a resident in the IMLS-funded National Digital Stewardship Residency. IMLS support of this residency program enabled dozens of early-career digital preservationists to enter this field, which otherwise offered few options for recent graduates to gain practical experience in digital stewardship. Later serving as a grant reviewer for IMLS I came to really understand the breadth of their activities and the amount of expertise, time, and consideration the staff of IMLS put into the grant programs. Their work touches so many communities and the positive trickle-down impacts are incalculable.", Unnamed Federal Employee, 
"IMLS creates jobs. Every IMLS-funded research grant I've been part of has either created new jobs or extended opportunities for existing staff at our nation's libraries and museums.", Chris Freeland (Florida),
"IMLS funded Digital POWRR when I attended. Without this program, I would never have been able to develop a digital preservation workflow for the archives at which I worked. I am from Canada, and I think it's good for people to know that IMLS funded programs helped on both sides of the border.", Mary Grace Kosta (Ontario),
"Interlibrary loan is basically a miracle and so many people take it for granted.", Kate Crowe (Colorado),
"IMLS helps me offer needed resources in my community and continue my education as a library staff. Without the resources and grants from this facility I cannot expand my already busy Makerspace to offer Fix-It clinics that are popular in my community. Without their work my library cannot offer wifi hotspots to people who cannot afford Internet but need it for work, or school, or for their job applications. IMLS will help ensure that the job that I love will continue, and that I can ensure access to new technology and teaching methods to enrich my community. There are private library systems near me - they are underpaid, have no union, and offer far less resources than the public library system I work for. People in my community often travel to the next town over because the privately managed library does not have what they want, and does not offer diverse programming to reflect the many varied citizens and ethnicities in our city. The private system offers less services and books in other languages which is a terrible mistake in a community known for its polylingual community - my public library routinely offers diverse programming and I work to ensure our fliers are available in the ten most used languages in my community. We NEED public libraries to continue to foster early childhood literacy, help with ESL groups, offer a place for people to congregate where they can learn and improve their lives, and where imaginations can be fostered to create the next batch of inventors and artists. We need libraries - and we need them to stay public.", Krystal Williamson (California),
