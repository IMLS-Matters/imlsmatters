"I got my start in digital librarianship on a IMLS grant-funded position at the Louisiana State Museum in 2005. I was a newly minted Master's in Museum Studies professional, looking for my first job in museums with the seemingly catch-22 of needing years of experience for the most entry level positions. I was particularly thrilled since this job at the time married the digital and physical worlds in the scope of the grant project, with hands on collection and digitization work, and of course also providing that key experience I was so desperately seeking to get my foot in the door. I have since spent 17 years working in academic libraries managing digital initiatives, and I think back to this experience and am so so grateful it was there to lead me to where I am today.

"During the early days of the Pandemic, IMLS was the best resource on what to do regarding treating archival objects + book loans. They were fair and scientifically based, and helped to calm down a number of librarians from across the US through their webinars on the topic.",Ben Kass (Virginia),
"IMLS matters to me and my library community, a Title I school in Delaware. We depend on IMLS funding in Delaware because it allows us to be included in the statewide library catalog. That means that our students and teachers can access books from libraries across the entire state. This allows us to access eBooks from Hoopla and Libby, which IMLS also funds in Delaware. IMLS also funds the statewide courier delivery which allows those books to travel to and from every library in the state. This helps my students to read and learn about anything that their hearts desire - from books about volleyball and cooking and rocks and minerals to books about Sonic the Hedgehog and the Wizard of Oz. Access to every book in our state allows my students the opportunity to foster their love of reading and know no limits to what they can read about. 
IMLS also funds professional development for librarians in the state of Delaware. Being a professional librarian is extremely important to me. It is my life's work. It is so important to me that I have access to learning opportunities to better myself, to be the best librarian that I can be for my students!",Sara Thomas (Delaware),
"IMLS is the reason I have a career in libraries. I joined a project funded by IMLS as a graduate student worker; the Religion in North Carolina Digital Collections, in 2012. This project was led by Duke Divinity School Library, and had UNC Chapel Hill and Wake Forest University as collaborative partners. When I graduated, the project coordinator position was open for the final year of the grant, and this was my first step into what became a decade of working in libraries. What sticks with me most, however, is the impact that this government funding had on the people we served. This project worked to bring collections that were being stored in people’s attics, basements, and back rooms to new audiences. Yes, it focused on digitising many of the (scarce, not-digitally available) small-time newsletters, bulletins, church directories, and synagogue cookbooks in the collections of these universities, but the crucial, good thing that this project accomplished was to bring federal funding to small religious communities whose materials the universities had not historically deemed interesting or worthy of collecting; it forged new relationships, and allowed myself and others on the project to act as a bridge for preserving scarce materials that might otherwise have been lost to disaster. Frankly, some of the collections we digitized came from communities in western North Carolina; I don’t know what has become of he originals in the wake of the horrific flooding and mudslides of 2024. Human lives are paramount; but history and culture are vital to human life, and also worth preserving. I owe a great deal to IMLS, personally and professionally, as do many communities in NC and beyond. I’m forever grateful for the opportunities they furnished to students, communities, and heritage.", Beth DeBold, 
"The funds IMLS provides Montanans helps bring quality, essential library services to all Montanans. Their steadying leadership has made libraries better across the country, as well as improving the lives of those in my state. We rely upon and require their continued funding and leadership. I am a prior member and a former chair of the Montana State Library Commission.", Bruce Newell (Montana), 
"My first role after grad school was as a resident in the IMLS-funded National Digital Stewardship Residency. IMLS support of this residency program enabled dozens of early-career digital preservationists to enter this field, which otherwise offered few options for recent graduates to gain practical experience in digital stewardship. Later serving as a grant reviewer for IMLS I came to really understand the breadth of their activities and the amount of expertise, time, and consideration the staff of IMLS put into the grant programs. Their work touches so many communities and the positive trickle-down impacts are incalculable.", Unnamed Federal Employee, 
"IMLS creates jobs. Every IMLS-funded research grant I've been part of has either created new jobs or extended opportunities for existing staff at our nation's libraries and museums.", Chris Freeland (Florida),
"IMLS funded Digital POWRR when I attended. Without this program, I would never have been able to develop a digital preservation workflow for the archives at which I worked. I am from Canada, and I think it's good for people to know that IMLS funded programs helped on both sides of the border.", Mary Grace Kosta (Ontario),
"Interlibrary loan is basically a miracle and so many people take it for granted.", Kate Crowe (Colorado),
"IMLS helps me offer needed resources in my community and continue my education as a library staff. Without the resources and grants from this facility I cannot expand my already busy Makerspace to offer Fix-It clinics that are popular in my community. Without their work my library cannot offer wifi hotspots to people who cannot afford Internet but need it for work, or school, or for their job applications. IMLS will help ensure that the job that I love will continue, and that I can ensure access to new technology and teaching methods to enrich my community. There are private library systems near me - they are underpaid, have no union, and offer far less resources than the public library system I work for. People in my community often travel to the next town over because the privately managed library does not have what they want, and does not offer diverse programming to reflect the many varied citizens and ethnicities in our city. The private system offers less services and books in other languages which is a terrible mistake in a community known for its polylingual community - my public library routinely offers diverse programming and I work to ensure our fliers are available in the ten most used languages in my community. We NEED public libraries to continue to foster early childhood literacy, help with ESL groups, offer a place for people to congregate where they can learn and improve their lives, and where imaginations can be fostered to create the next batch of inventors and artists. We need libraries - and we need them to stay public.", Krystal Williamson (California),
"Small LSTA grants through our state library helped automate so many small libraries and join library consortia — opening up access to many more collections and removing numerous barriers for tiny staffs. The funds purchase equipment and materials and more. That work never would have happened and communities never would have had the access they do today without that funding. IMLS also funds important library and information science research, and helps states efficiently leverage dollars that help libraries maximize already limited funded. IMLS — an agency with a tiny budget and tiny staff — impacts every single library and museum across this country. Oh and an IMLS grant 20 years ago helped craft what became Zotero. Behind each IMLS grant is a story — that leads to more stories.", anon. (Kansas),
"IMLS understands the value of open source: how it naturally brings creative and motivated individuals/organizations together to form collaborations, problem-solve, iterate on ideas, try new things, produce and share the results of such efforts, and ultimately build community that is inspired to contribute back and feed the cycle all over again. IMLS does not, has not, will never ever tear things down.", Hannah Frost (California),
"The IMLS has enabled me, a solo worker in a special collections environment, to collaborate with peer orgs to learn new skills and complete projects to increase access. This funding has contributed to my org being able to archive web content documenting local government, responses to COVID-19, monitoring DEI efforts in the current admin to see what content changes, backing up the efforts of small heritage orgs to safeguard against loss should those sites go down, and documenting social services for those experiencing homelessness. IMLS funding is important to maintaining repositories like the Internet Archive. Other IMLS grants have revolved around learning new tech like VR360 in order to make locations more accessible, including merging archival images into current 360 footage to allow past/present views.", anon. (Washington),
"IMLS is everywhere in libraries. It enables collections to be made available online through new and improved search and discovery systems. It offers support for thinking and doing (planning grants from IMLS are one of the best ideas ever). It helps smaller libraries get equipment and resources to digitize which means there is a chance that small town and rural America doesn't lose its history as physical documents deteriorate. IMLS keeps libraries running. I always get tripped up on whether it is the Institute FOR Museum and Library Services or the Institute OF Museum and Library Services. It is OF because it is us - it is our libraries and our museums.", Julie Hardesty (Indiana),
"For decades, IMLS has expanded access to museum, library, and archival resources past the borders of our individual institutions through the funding of grants to preserve, catalog, digitize, and publish online important special collections. In doing so, they created hundreds, if not thousands, of jobs--many of which provided early career opportunities for students and new professionals in the GLAM field who have gone on to do amazing work in their communities. In recent years, IMLS partnered with The Field Museum (natural history and science), History Colorado (history), and the Indianapolis Museum of Art at Newfields (art and public garden), along with dozens of other museums of all disciplines to create Museums for Digital Learning (https://museumsfordigitallearning.org/) -- a free platform for museums to create and publish collections-focused K-12 educational resources completely open to the public for educators to incorporate into their classroom lessons and home school families to supplement their curriculum. The MDL website is still live for now, but if it is shut down due to the dissolution of IMLS it will be a great loss, both for the libraries, archives, and museums who were sharing and could have shared their collections in meaningful, usable ways with teachers and students, and for those K-12 communities who had the chance to connect with museums that they may never had the chance to visit in person.", anon. (Maryland),
"I have dedicated my twenty year professional career to the IMLS Grants to States Program. I have seen firsthand the impact the program has on my state's public libraries. IMLS is our partner in developing and empowering libraries to serve their communities. Without IMLS, the landscape of public library service in my state would look completely different. I am beyond grateful to IMLS and the invaluable work they do.", anon.,
"I received a full scholarship to earn my Master's in Information Sciences from the University of Tennessee Knoxville that was funded through IMLS. At the time, I was a one-person-show library director in rural West Virginia. After I graduated, I went on to work as a prison librarian in WV and Maryland. Without the scholarship funds I never would have pursued higher education. I am so very grateful to IMLS for their care, their work, and their commitment to libraries, library workers, museums, and museum workers.", Mary Rayme (Maryland),
"IMLS funded an Open Science Primer program that I attended recently with several of my colleagues. It was an extremely valuable event where we updated our knowledge, discussed strategies to support open science at our institution, and connected to collaborators in our region.", Mara Sedlins (Colorado),
"KY receives $2.7 million in LSTA funds each year to support our state library and to provide subawards to public libraries.  Approximately 12 library development employees' wages are partially paid through LSTA funds.  Approximately $400,000 is provided to local libraries for continuing education, workforce development, literacy, and technology projects each year.  Some of these projects have included attending a national conference that they would not otherwise afford, purchasing computers, purchasing books for an outreach vehicle,  providing English Language Learning classes, and providing family literacy programs. The Department for Libraries and Archives provides the Kentucky Talking Book Program for the blind, providing audio and braille books to thousands of reading-challenged individuals. Participants receive materials regularly that helps ward off loneliness and isolation. Five regional consultants support 120 public libraries in the state by providing information, training, and consulting services to directors and library boards.  As a director, I relied heavily on our regional consultant to navigate many difficult situations in our community and staff. KY requires all full-time library staff to be certified.  Three employees work towards providing training and managing the certification program to ensure the law is followed to provide a well-trained library workforce.  I have benefited from these services as well and have grown professionally throughout my 15-year career in libraries because of KDLA training. The state library also benefits from LSTA funds.  Print and electronic materials are provided to state employees.  The KY Virtual Library is subsidized through LSTA funds, which provide electronic resources to public libraries and academic libraries throughout the state.  For many organizations, this is the only authoritative electronic resources they are able to afford for their communities. Personally, I have worked in libraries at the local and state level for 15 years.  I am proud of the service libraries provide to communities.", Dena Ratliff Warren (Kentucky),
"LSTA grants through IMLS are the reason so many opportunities for continuing education, literacy programs, and more can be offered by the state library.", anon. (Louisiana),
"Libraries have benefited me personally in so many ways. First, as a child who frequented the local library as a safe place to read and learn, also, as an educator seeking current, authentic, and engaging information and resources for my students, and finally, as a parent whose children have grown up to be adults that love to read and learn because our local library provided captivating and age-appropriate books, hosted amazing programming staffed by knowledgeable and caring staff, and afforded a safe place, to read, learn, and grow that they still frequently utilize as adults. IMLS provides essential funding to make libraries a safe, fun, and wonderful place for community members of all ages to connect, learn, grow, and explore. It also gives libraries the capacity to expand beyond their walls via online resources and outreach programs. My family uses the resources provided by our local library on a DAILY basis, and IMLS funds make these resources possible.", anon.,
"IMLS provided grants that helped my local museum, Museum of Boulder, develop exhibits about the hidden history of our town. It makes my experience of my town richer, gives my kids a place to learn, and makes space to connect with older family members.", Rebecca (Colorado),
"If it were not for the IMLS, I would probably not have a career in libraries. In the early 2000s, while I was working for the Brooklyn Public Library, I was privileged to take part in the Public Urban Library Service Education program, a partnership between Pratt Institute and Brooklyn Public Library that allowed me to pursue my Masters degree while continuing to work full time at the library. IMLS made that partnership possible. But that’s just me. IMLS brings essential funding to our field for countless purposes. Losing or reducing IMLS is devastating. Everyone needs to stand up for IMLS.", Nate Hill (New York), 
"IMLS has not only provided me the ability to scan and make accessible thousands of archival items through purchasing printers and scanners, but it is the only reason I was able to bring on my staff. IMLS gave me my team and allowed me to expand my archive's outreach far beyond anything we thought we could do. They are irreplaceable.", Emily (Indiana),
