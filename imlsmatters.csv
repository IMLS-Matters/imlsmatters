"I got my start in digital librarianship on a IMLS grant-funded position at the Louisiana State Museum in 2005. I was a newly minted Master's in Museum Studies professional, looking for my first job in museums with the seemingly catch-22 of needing years of experience for the most entry level positions. I was particularly thrilled since this job at the time married the digital and physical worlds in the scope of the grant project, with hands on collection and digitization work, and of course also providing that key experience I was so desperately seeking to get my foot in the door. I have since spent 17 years working in academic libraries managing digital initiatives, and I think back to this experience and am so so grateful it was there to lead me to where I am today.

"During the early days of the Pandemic, IMLS was the best resource on what to do regarding treat archival objects + book loans. They were fair and scientifically based, and helped to calm down a number of librarian from across the US through their webinars on the topic",Ben Kass,
"IMLS matters to me and my library community, a Title I school in Delaware. We depend on IMLS funding in Delaware because it allows us to be included in the statewide library catalog. That means that our students and teachers can access books from libraries across the entire state. This allows us to access eBooks from Hoopla and Libby, which IMLS also funds in Delaware. IMLS also funds the statewide courier delivery which allows those books to travel to and from every library in the state. This helps my students to read and learn about anything that their hearts desire - from books about volleyball and cooking and rocks and minerals to books about Sonic the Hedgehog and the Wizard of Oz. Access to every book in our state allows my students the opportunity to foster their love of reading and know no limits to what they can read about. 
IMLS also funds professional development for librarians in the state of Delaware. Being a professional librarian is extremely important to me. It is my life's work. It is so important to me that I have access to learning opportunities to better myself, to be the best librarian that I can be for my students!",Sara Thomas,
